# USER UX

 - User enter many tasks
 - Every task has its items (time item + check item)
 - User press (check item), then the task will be deleted
 - User press (time item) of a task then a window will open 
 - User set time of that chosen task 
 - User press (Ok or cancel buttons)
 - Clock will stroke and rotate based on countdown of chosen task
 - User may press (time item) again for another task or the chosen same task
 - User will finish his task and delete it.



=================================================	

#logic 

 - Tasks array has objects of every task

 - Every object will contain {taskName: "" , timerStart: number, ++id}

 - User press (add button)? Push to the (tasks) array

 - User press (check item)? Loop inside (tasks) and get the task based on task (ID) then filter 

 - User press (time item)? setShowTime(taskObject) and a (window conditional render) will open to the user 	(task details) he can set his task duration.
	inside conditional render, User Press cancel? setShowTime(null)
	inside conditional render, User chnage inputs? setNumber({taskDur: number , timeSet: min or hour})
	inside conditional render, User press Ok? send that number to the showTime object
		then send that showTime object to (tasks) array how send to task array? (loop based on ID)
		after finish sending that taskObject? setShowTime(null) to close the window

 - Another conditional render will be, beside task name, if there is taskDur

 - User press (time item) again? Go back to the function onClick of that (time icon)
	Loop inside (tasks) to find any taskDur. 
	True? ok there is task on progress. You will setShowTime({h2: "Sorry you need to concentrate on 		this task", taskOnProgress}
	false? setShowTime(taskObject) to set a task as we did before.
		in case the user has task on progress so the window will has 2 buttons
			User press (cancel)? setShowTime(null);
			User press (delete)? loop based on Id and delete






 
 - after the user added his task, he will click on (timer icon ) Then, a Dom will be opened to show his task and his time set
 - when the user enter his task and pressed the (timer icon) it will setShowTime(has task Object , ind) then open that Dom. 
 	Inside that timer dom, when the user press cancel => setShowTime(null)
	Inside that timer dom, when the user press Ok => firstly filter that Dom and adding new dom OOORRR reest in the array
 - If the user tried to click on another (timer icon)	He will find a message to complete his (task name) first
 - How will we do this? By looping inside the array if he found inside an object (timer start) The loop will stop and (sorry)
 - when the user press OK
