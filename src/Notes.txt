this task-timer will do the following:

- when the user enter his task ? 
	there will be controls like (check icon). This to delete the task
	another control is (set time icon) This to put time estimated. For example (making Coffe. It may take 20 min)

=================================================	

#logic 

 - Every task will be object. This object will contain {taskName: "" , timerStart: number}
 - after the user added his task, he will click on (timer icon ) Then, a Dom will be opened to show his task and his time set
 - when the user enter his task and pressed the (timer icon) it will setShowTime(has task Object , ind) then open that Dom. 
 	Inside that timer dom, when the user press cancel => setShowTime(null)
	Inside that timer dom, when the user press Ok => firstly filter that Dom and adding new dom OOORRR reest in the array
 - If the user tried to click on another (timer icon)	He will find a message to complete his (task name) first
 - How will we do this? By looping inside the array if he found inside an object (timer start) The loop will stop and (sorry)
